I'm passionate about front-end and growing with my team of developers and designers to create beautiful websites. Web development is an ever evolving and fast moving industry which fuels my desire to learn new technologies and experiement with interesting tools. My knowledge and tool set not only includes a solid foundation of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but also some of the latest tools like React, Redux, Webpack and GraphQl.  When not building web pages, I spend my time with my wife Ingrid, my daughter Isabella and my dog Baloo. I enjoy staying active in with boxing, snowboarding and when the weather permits, a good braai in the park."
