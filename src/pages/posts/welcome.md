Starting things off, I'm Andrew McKeever a web developer working in Germany originating from the US. After completing a B.S. in Psychology from Iowa State University, I spent a couple years in South Korea teaching English. It was there that I met my beautiful wife Ingrid; she would eventually convince me (with very little twisting of my arm required) to move to Hamburg. After spending a few years continuing to teach English, I began my programming journey. Going professional took nearly a year of self-teaching and quite a bit of luck, but I'll save that story for another post. So, with all the introduction out of the way let's get to the main focus of this post,

#"Why a private blog, Why Gatsby, Why?"
"Why a private blog?” it's like totally 2019 man and Medium exists". True, but a large part of my decision for my own blog was so that I could comfortably improve my writing. For me personally, this is blog is another way to deepen my knowledge of computer science to become a better developer; not to become some famous industry leader. I think it will also be nice to look back at past articles to see how my knowledge has evolved which I fear I would remove any unpopular articles if I used a site like medium.

 #"Why Gatsby?!
Admittedly, I have to say after working with Gatsby it probably was not the best choice for a blog. React itself doesn’t really shine well with a static page with little interaction. Quite a few areas of the documentation are lacking on Gatsby which means once you’re stuck, it’s all up to you to find the work around. However, it gave me the opportunity to learn some new things and realize what Gatsby isn’t for.
Alright, so that wraps up the first post, hopefully you enjoyed getting to know me a bit more.
